# US_Terror
## Intro

This is another terrorism project however, I do not intend for it to be as
expansive as my other projects. The dataset, as usual, came from Kaggle.
Specific site is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/newamerica/terrorist-activity

I do have to say that doing terrorism projects gets old but I needed
another project to do and the data was there. So, decided why not. Also, even
though I have done terrorism projects on Europe and the world I have never
done one specifically on the U.S. I do have to admit and stress that I do have
a background in International Relations and political science so I love to do
these types of projects! It is a way for me to merge two of my passions
together.
